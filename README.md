# Country listing app for demo purposes

You can see the deployed app here: https://country-listing-green.vercel.app/

## What I have done

- I have created a simple app that lists countries and their details
- I have used **Create React App** to bootstrap the app
- I have used **React Router** to handle routing
- I have used **Redux** to handle state management
- I have used **RTK Query** to handle API calls
- For styling I have used **Tailwind CSS**
- I have used Vercel to deploy the app (https://country-listing-green.vercel.app/)
- I have used **TypeScript**
- I have used **ESLint** and **Prettier** to lint and format the code
- I have used **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to write unit tests
- I have used **GitHub Actions** to run the unit tests on every push
- I have added **Dockerfile** to build the app as a Docker image
